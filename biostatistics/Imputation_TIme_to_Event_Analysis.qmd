## Imputation and Time to Event Analysis 

My attempt at taking data from a Time to Event Dataset in the form of a CDISC data set, removing random data points then using Multiple Imputation Chained Equations to impute the missing data. COmparative Analyses are then done to show the differences.

This analysis makes little sense in the "real world" but it is more to show that I can do it.

To do this I used QUarto and produced a PDF report with the code.
